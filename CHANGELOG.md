## [0.2.0] - 2025-08-03

### ðŸ”„ Major Database Architecture Enhancement

This release introduces a comprehensive scope-based database isolation system to prevent conflicts when developing multiple projects in parallel.

### Added

#### Scope-Based Database Isolation
- **Project-scoped installation**: Database stored in `.axon/axon-mcp.sqlite` within project directory
- **User-scoped installation**: Database stored in user data directory with project-specific hash isolation
- **Dynamic scope detection**: Automatic detection based on executable location and project markers
- **Environment overrides**: Support for `AXON_MCP_SCOPE` and `AXON_MCP_DB` environment variables

#### Enhanced Installation System
- **Project-scope installation**: New `--claude-code-project` CLI switch for project-specific installation
- **User-scope installation**: New `--claude-code-user` CLI switch for global installation
- **Smart automation**: Automatic `.gitignore` management for `.axon/` directories
- **Claude Code integration**: Automatic `claude mcp add` when `.claude/` folder is detected
- **Interactive prompts**: User-friendly installation with sensible defaults

#### Security & Reliability Improvements
- **Legacy database migration**: Automatic migration from `~/axon-mcp.sqlite` to new scope-based locations
- **Secure file permissions**: Database files protected with 0600/0700 permissions on Unix systems  
- **Atomic migration**: Safe database migration with verification and backup retention
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Enhanced Windows PowerShell and Unix shell installers

### Changed

#### Database Path Resolution
- **Breaking Change**: Default database location changed from `~/axon-mcp.sqlite` to scope-based paths:
  - Project scope: `{project-root}/.axon/axon-mcp.sqlite`
  - User scope: `{user-data-dir}/axon-mcp/dbs/{project-hash}.sqlite`
- **Automatic migration**: Legacy databases automatically migrated to new locations
- **Hash-based isolation**: User-scope databases use SHA256 project path hash for isolation

#### Installation Experience
- **Enhanced CLI**: Both shell and PowerShell installers support new scope-based installation modes
- **Improved automation**: Smart detection of Git repositories and Claude Code projects
- **Better error handling**: Clear error messages for common installation scenarios

### Fixed
- **Multi-project conflicts**: Resolved database sharing conflicts between parallel development projects
- **Test suite reliability**: All tests now pass with no warnings
- **Platform detection**: Fixed ARM64 macOS detection in self-update functionality
- **Clippy warnings**: Eliminated all linter warnings across the codebase

### Technical Details

#### Migration Strategy
- Legacy `~/axon-mcp.sqlite` automatically detected and migrated
- Migration only occurs for user-scope installations when new database doesn't exist
- Original database preserved for backup purposes with clear user instructions
- Migration marker created to prevent repeated migration attempts

#### Security Enhancements
- Database directories created with secure permissions (0700 on Unix)
- Database files protected with owner-only access (0600 on Unix)
- Windows relies on NTFS permissions for security
- Path traversal vulnerabilities eliminated through canonicalization

### Breaking Changes
- **Database Location**: Default database location changed (with automatic migration)
- **Environment Variables**: `AXON_MCP_SCOPE` now affects database path resolution

### Migration Guide
1. **Automatic Migration**: For most users, migration happens automatically on first run
2. **Manual Override**: Use `AXON_MCP_DB` environment variable to specify custom database path
3. **Scope Control**: Use `AXON_MCP_SCOPE=project` or `AXON_MCP_SCOPE=user` to control scope detection
4. **Legacy Cleanup**: After verifying migration worked, legacy `~/axon-mcp.sqlite` can be safely deleted
